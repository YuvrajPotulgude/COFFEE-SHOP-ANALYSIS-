Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyse the sales data of a coffee shop to uncover trends and insights related to sales performance, customer behaviour, and product preferences. The project also includes data cleaning and transformations to ensure the data was in the right format for analysis and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset was provided by Maven Analytics and contains various columns, including:

Date

Transaction ID

Product Category

Product Name

Quantity Sold

Total Sales Amount

Location

Tools and Technologies

Python: For data cleaning and analysis.

Numpy: To perform numerical calculations on computational data 

Pandas: Used for data manipulation.

Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and analysis.

Power BI: For creating dashboards and visualizations.

Excel: The original format of the dataset.

Project Steps

Data Loading: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas Data Frame.

Data Cleaning: Data time separation, product size separation, adding new columns and corrected inconsistent data entries.

Data Transformation: Processed data to create new features (e.g., sales per location, top-selling products).

Data Analysis: Analysed trends such as:

Total sales over time.

Most popular products.

Sales by location.

Visualization: Power BI dashboards were created to visualize the analysis.

Visualizations

The Power BI dashboards included:

Sales by Product Category: A breakdown of the sales for each product category.

Top Selling Products: Insights into which products generate the most revenue.

Sales Over Time: A time series of total sales across different locations.

Location-Based Performance: Comparison of sales performance between locations.

How to Run
Prerequisites

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI Desktop

Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn in my project I created visualizations using powerbi which makes easier you can create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Conclusion

This project provided insights into the coffee shopâ€™s sales patterns and customer preferences. By using data-driven decisions, the coffee shop can optimize product offerings, improve sales strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
